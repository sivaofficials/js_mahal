                        <b>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</b> Before either party may seek
                        arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing
                        the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
                        Company should be sent to: #50, Park Rd, Soundarya Colony, Anna Nagar West Extension,
                        Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600101. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may
                        attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve
                        the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may
                        begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
                        not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the
                        award to which either party is entitled.

                        <b>Arbitration Rules.</b> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
                        Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
                        forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
                        alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
                        arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
                        Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by
                        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
                        arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than
                        Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding nonappearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
                        where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or
                        more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be
                        held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United
                        States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
                        shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
                        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                        jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer
                        that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you
                        the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
                        arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR
                        Provider

                    <p>
                        <b>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</b> If non-appearance based
                        arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based
                        solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the
                        arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
                        witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

                    <p>
                        <b>Time Limits.</b> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be
                        initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed
                        under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

                        <b>Authority of Arbitrator.</b> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
                        liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                        grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                        award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
                        individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a
                        written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
                        which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                        individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
                        and binding upon you and the Company.

                        <b>Waiver of Jury Trial.</b> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
                        AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF
                        A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
                        arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more
                        limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to
                        very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the
                        Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or
                        otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL,
                        instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

                        Very hospitable set of people who run the business. The hall is new and fresh and has a very good ambience. The look and feel of the mandapam is very appealing too.
                        Would definitely recommend you to visit the place and book your functions.<br /><b>Anirudh K.S.</b>
